## ADQL User Defined Functions catalogue

This is the source code for the list of interoperable user defined functions
for the Astronomical Data Query Language ADQL.  To understand where this
fits into the Virtual Observatory, see the [ADQL Standard](https://ivoa.net/documents/ADQL), sect. 4.3 (in version 2.2).

Stable versions of this are published in the IVOA document repository at
http://ivoa.net/documents/udf-catalogue/.

To build a PDF version this document, you will need a reasonably
complete LaTeX installation, a sufficiently capable `make`, preferably
[latexmk](https://personal.psu.edu/~jcc8/software/latexmk/) and probably
[rsvg-convert](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg). For further
details, see [ivoatexDoc](https://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOATex/).

Informationally – and for the benefit of implementors looking for patterns
possibly already established –, we include a list of non-ivo UDFs found in a
census of TAP services in the VO; this is updated now and then and of course
entirely non-normative.
See: [udf_list.rst](/ivoa-std/udf-catalogue/blob/improve-non-ivo-cat/collect-udf/udf_list.rst).
